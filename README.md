# Custom Firmware for Elecrow Watering Kit 2.1

I purchased the (Elecrow Watering Kit 2.1)[https://www.elecrow.com/arduino-automatic-smart-plant-watering-kit.html] 
from Amazon. The controller board for this kit has an integrated
Arduino Leonardo.

The included firmware (and the firmware found on the Elecrow site) has issues, notably graphical gitches.

I found the (liutyi version of the firmware)[https://wiki.liutyi.info/display/ARDUINO/Custom+firmware+for+Elecrow+Watering+Kit] that fixed these
gitches, so I've forked their code for any furuture customizations.

The original Elecrow code can be found in the `orig/` folder.
