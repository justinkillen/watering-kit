# Custom Firmware for Elecrow Watering Kit 2.1

I purchased the [Elecrow Watering Kit 2.1](https://www.elecrow.com/arduino-automatic-smart-plant-watering-kit.html)
from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Elecrow-Watering-Moisture-Gardening-Automatic/dp/B07LCNKC6N). 
The controller board for this kit has an integrated
Arduino Leonardo.

The included firmware (and the firmware found on the Elecrow site) has issues, notably graphical gitches.

I found a [version of the firmware](https://github.com/liutyi/elecrow-watering-kit-2-li)
modified by [liutyi](https://wiki.liutyi.info/display/ARDUINO/Arduino+Automatic+Smart+Plant+Watering+Kit+2.0a) 
that fixed these gitches. I've forked their code for any future customizations.

The original Elecrow code can be found in the `orig/` folder.
